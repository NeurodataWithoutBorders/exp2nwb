This folder contains a "toy" example that illustrates the usage of the code stored in the folder src.

The example is implemented as a Jupyter notebook, and can be run using the Jupyter application.

It generates several partial NWB files in folder 'Project_folder' and then assembles them to produce a full-size NWB file named Example.nwb. 

After the assembly, a validation check is performed.
